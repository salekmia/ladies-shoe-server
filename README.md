<h3>Before Start</h3>

Jhangkar Mahbub Bhai has asked to do this project as an assignment. Almost everything I have learned in four months has to be applied in this project. There is some fear in the mind. But there is nothing to do. Fear must be overcome. However, I decided to create a Ladies Shoe project. Let's see how much I can do.

<h3>Details</h3>

We can create a server in three steps.
1. First you have to create a project and then create a project by entering npm init.
2. Create a file named index.js.
3. Some tools need to be installed. E.g. express, cors, mongodb, nodemon, dotenv

After creating the server in three steps, you have to write the code in each step.
We can also do this by looking at the documentation of the five step note express.

After writing the code in five steps, our task is to make a connection of our server with mongodb atlas. It takes a lot of work to do that.
> You need to login to mongodb
> There the user has to create
> IP address must be added
> You need to connect mongodb to the server
> To connect, we need to use some of their code on our server.
> User name and password must be given in the code.
